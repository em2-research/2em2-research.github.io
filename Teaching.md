### Fall 2021
#### [EMCH 213: Strength of Materials](https://bulletins.psu.edu/university-course-descriptions/undergraduate/emch/)
**Course description**:

In this elementary course on the strength of materials, the response of some simple structural components is analyzed in a consistent manner using i) equilibrium equations, ii) material law equations, and iii) the geometry of deformation. 

The components analyzed include rods subjected to axial loading, shafts loaded in torsion, slender beams in bending, thin-walled pressure vessels, slender columns susceptible to buckling, as well as some more complex structures and loads where stress transformations are used to determine principal stresses and the maximum shear stress. 

The free body diagram is indispensable in each of these applications for relating the applied loads to the internal forces and moments and plotting internal force diagrams. Material behavior is restricted to be that of materials in the linear elastic range. A description of the geometry of deformation is necessary to determine internal forces and moments in statically indeterminate problems. The underlying mathematics are boundary value problems where governing differential equations are solved subject to known boundary conditions.

### Spring 2022
#### ESC/MatSE 597: Introduction to Transmission Electron Microscopy
**Course description**:

Transmission electron microscopy, diffraction, and spectroscopy have been widely applied to characterize materials structures and defects that are responsible for materialsâ€™ properties. We will introduce the fundamentals of these techniques in this course, emphasizing the interpretation of the experimental data from these characterization experiments. Also, an introduction of the recent new techniques, including in-situ environmental TEM, four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) technique, and atomic-resolution electron tomography, will be provided.

The degradation of structural materials under harsh environments, such as high temperature, corrosion, radiation damage and mechanical deformation, may lead to a series of problems impacting the society and economy. For example, rust induced by corrosion is one of the main causes of bridge accidents. For another example, the hydrogen generated by the water-side high-temperature oxidation of zirconium alloy led to the explosions in the Fukushima accident.

Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of materials’s degradation is vital for the development of more robust structural materials. The micro-structures and defects in materials have a great impact on the performance of materials, while they are usually too small to be characterized by human’s eyes and optical microscopes.  In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique enables the direct observation of the evolution of microstructures and defects at a spatial resolution scaling from 0.1 nm to 10,000 nm, offering the opportunity to discover or validate the fundamental mechanisms of materials’ failure at the atomic or nano scale.
